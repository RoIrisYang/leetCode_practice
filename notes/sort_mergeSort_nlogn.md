# Merge Sort

- time complexity: nlogn
- concept of divide and conquer

## Process
- pick the middle one and seperate the array of size n into 2 subset, l and r.
- recursively do the same with the subset of left elements and the subset of right elements, untill all elements are sorted.
- when l and r are both a single element, compare them and sort.
- conquer and insert them at right places.
